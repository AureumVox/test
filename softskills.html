        <h2>Sales Mastery Training</h2>
            <p>As Jack Welch, the then CEO of GE once famously said "Nothing
               happens until someone sells something". In this training session 
               your staff will learn the basics of selling. Working extensively with
               Robert C Cialdini's powerful theories on influence, your staff will
               move beyond mere technique and come to understand the
               underlying mechanics of why people buy, and how to use these
               mechanics to sell more of your products.<br><br>

               This is an advanced course that assumes a previous knowledge of
               sales techniques.</p><br>

        <h2>Customer Service Bootcamp</h2>
            <p>While often not as valued as sales, great customer service has the 
               ability to transform the culture of your company and create "brand  
               evangelists", who are customers that love your brand and travel the  
               world selling your products for free. In this course your staff will  
               learn the underlying principles of customer service, and how to  
               make every interaction with your customers a powerful example of  
               why they should continue to deal with your company.<br><br>

               This course assumes no prior understanding of customer service  
               mechanics, but the principles being taught are applicable to anyone  
               in a customer service role, regardless of tenure!</p><br>

        <h2>Advanced Complaints Resolution</h2>
            <p>Customer complaints can easily escalate the point 
               of going out of control, or the customer can be turned around to become 
               a future brand evangelist. The difference is almost always the way the 
               complaint was handled and responded to. Using the L.A.S.T techniques and 
               using theory from "The Difficult Guest" your staff will learn how to 
               proactively manage the most extreme of customer complaints, and turn 
               them around.<br><br>

               This course assumes a solid understanding of Customer Service principles, 
               and is very tightly focussed on specifically dealing with very difficult 
               customers and customer issues.</p><br>
